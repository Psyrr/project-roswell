Project Roswell is collection of modifications created by myself for XCOM: Chimera Squad by Firaxis.

The modpack seeks to enrich the players in-game experience through a number of changes either adding additional features, 
quality of life changes or fixing bugs left in the game by Firaxis themselves. The player is able to select which of 
these changes they would like to add to their game as they have all been individually packaged in the "indep-mods" 
directory through following the installation instructions (Please note although individually packaged all the mods 
are conflict free and compatible with each other).

Development of Project Roswell began on the 21st of July 2020 alongside my university work and has grown to what you see now.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding Project Roswell, you are welcome to contact me on Git or Steam.
