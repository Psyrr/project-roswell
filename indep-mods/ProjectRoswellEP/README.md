This mod gives all enemy entities the ability "Preparation" which is a clone of the Hunker Down ability
given to the player providing static bonus modifiers to defence and dodge. Ultimately the use of this mod will result
in the base game posing an extra challenge to the user as enemies will have an extra tool in their AI Tree to use against the
player. 

This mod is compatible with "ProjectRoswellAI" which will provide logic and checks to govern its use,
otherwise it will only be usable during mind control.

BONUS FIX: An unintentional fix of this mod is that it allows the Psion Fracture which is the only enemy in the game which should
have this ability to actually be able to use it as Firaxis didn't handle it inheriting from Shelter properly.

### Dependencies

The ability added as the primary focus of this modification lacks a place in the AI trees decision making process by default making
it reliant on the content of "ProjectRoswellAI" to work properly.

Without "ProjectRoswellAI", downloading will have little to no effect on your game.

### Known Bugs

N/A as of this time.
