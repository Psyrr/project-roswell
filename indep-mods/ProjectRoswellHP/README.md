With-in XCOM: CS, HP values for both enemies and friendly entities is displayed as a series of pips above the entity with the number of them
denoting the representant entities current health meaning currently it requires the player to count these pips to gauge health.

This mod changes the UI (Overrides UIUnitFlag) so that the plain text value of the entities health is displayed below these pips to  so the value is available in plain text in-addition to the pips 
meaning they no longer need to be counted. (Displayed as Current/Total - E.g. 3/4)
