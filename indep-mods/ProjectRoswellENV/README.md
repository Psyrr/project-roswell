Changes to the .ini files rebalancing the effect certain weapons and abilities have on in-game terrain. As I found it extremely
perplexing in the base game missed pistol shots are able to explode walls while grenades and guns the size of artillery pieces didn't leave so much as a scratch.

Environmental damage is quantified on a scale of 0 (Nothing) to 20 (Most destructive) with 5 point being needed to destroy low cover assets and 10 for high cover assets.

Values of 10+ will destroy most surfaces with the exception of reinforced UFO walls requiring the max value of 20.

### Friendly Changes

* Swords no longer inflict any form of environmental damage (Down to 0 from 5).
* ARs down to 3 from 7.
* SMG down to 2 from 6.
* Shotgun down to 4 from 8.
* Pistol down to 1 from 5.
* Gauntlets no longer inflict any form of environmental damage (Down to 0 from 5).
* Shields no longer inflict any form of environmental damage (Down to 0 from 1).
* Plasma Grenades down to 12 from 20.
* Frag Grenades down to 8 from 10.
* Fire Grenades up to 4 from 1.
* Acid Grenades up to 2 from 1.
* Shrapnel up to 4 from 1.
* All epic weapons have been reduced from 20 to the same as their regular counterparts.

### Enemy Changes

* Enemy guns and grenades usually have direct equivalence to the above and as a result follow the same rules as the friendly weapons with exceptions being displayed below.
* Andromedon Punch up from 0 to 5.
* All Zombie Melee attacks down to 1 from 5.
* Archon Staff down from 10 to 5.
* Sectopod WrathCannon up to 20 from 1.
* SectopodLightningField up to 5 from 1.

### Misc Changes

* Cars should now require multiple shots to explode now with the exception of grenades fixing the issue in the base game of them exploding for no reason.
* Quake Environmental damage down to 4 from 10.

### Version Log

* 1.0 - Initial Release
* 1.1 - Removed environmental damage for ability templates which where hardcoded (Zombie, fist, Archon Staff, Subdue and RiotBash)
* 1.2 - All abilities in the game are now rebalanced.
