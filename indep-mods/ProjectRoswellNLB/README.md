This fix changes Torque's ability "bind" to  render enemies unconscious and allow their capture instead of killing them. This is curious 
the comments in the base game intend it to be Nonlethal but set it to kill so this fixes this.

### Conflicts & Compatibility

This mod also will not work if downloaded mid-mission as it requires a fresh game state, however it can be safely added, used or removed
at any other point.

This mod is compatible and makes accommodations for "Enemy Capture Counter" by MonJamp.

### Known Bugs

N/A as of this time.

### Version Log

* 1.0 - Initial Release
* 1.1 - Fixed bug introduced in 1.2 where enemies that were immune to unconscious effect were crashing the game when bound.
* 1.1b - Bug in 1.1 persisted for Codex enemies fixed here.
