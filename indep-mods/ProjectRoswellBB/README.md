In the interest of accessibility and those, such as myself who play on smaller monitors. This modpack makes the icons 
used to target enemy/explosive entities and ability icons 1.5x bigger.

The layering of the icons was also changes to give some space between the UI elements and a unique layout.

(Targets above Abilities -> Abilities over Targets)
