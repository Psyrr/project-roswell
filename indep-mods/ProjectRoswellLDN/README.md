A small fix for all intents and purposes that remedies Zephyrâ€™s lockdown attack not being a guaranteed hit.

I implemented this fix as Firaxis use Templar Bladestorm from XCOM 2 as the basis of this ability which was a guaranteed hit 
and has active references within the codebase of this game to suggest so, however in the localisation files there is no change
so I can assume this was a mistake.

This mod ultimately fixes this inconsistency. 

### Conflicts & Compatibility

This mod also will not work if downloaded mid-mission as it requires a fresh game state, however it can be safely added, used or removed
at any other point.

### Known Bugs

N/A as of this time.
