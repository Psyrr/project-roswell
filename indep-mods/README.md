Project Roswell is collection of modifications created by myself for XCOM: Chimera Squad by Firaxis.

The modpack seeks to enrich the players in-game experience through a number of changes either adding additional features, 
quality of life changes or fixing bugs left in the game by Firaxis themselves. The player is able to select which of 
these changes they would like to add to their game as they have all been individually packaged in the "indep-mods" 
directory through following the installation instructions (Please note although individually packaged all the mods 
are conflict free and compatible with each other).

Development of Project Roswell began on the 21st of July 2020 alongside my university work and has grown to what you see now.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding Project Roswell, you are welcome to contact me on Git or Steam.

### Features

Each of the packages seen about is an individual modification which I have developed as part of the Project Roswell 
family. Here is a brief overview of each which will be expanded with-in.

* ProjectRoswellAI (Improved AI)

Without a doubt the most extensive modification with-in this modpack as it for all intents and purposes, 
this modpack removes near all restrictions places on the AI for "fairness" purposes, changes the logic used in the AI trees to make enemy behaviour more logical,
changes core mechanics to be more punishing, adds abilities and items to enemies and finally fixes bugs/mistakes left 
in the game by Firaxis (E.g. Spectral Zombies invoking an attack which does not exist in the core game files, etc).

Resulting in a AI which is completely unchained while obeying all rules placed on the player (Cooldowns, Ammo, etc.) 
presenting a whole new level of difficult which hardened players will find enjoyable.

* ProjectRoswellBB (Bigger Buttons)

In the interest of accessibility and those, such as myself who play on smaller monitors. This modpack makes the icons 
used to target enemy/explosive entities and ability icons 1.5x bigger.

* ProjectRoswellENV (Environmental Damage Rebalancing)

Changes to the .ini files changing the effect certain weapons and abilities have on in-game terrain. As I found it extremely
perplexing in the base game missed pistol shots are able to explode walls while grenades are not able to. 

* ProjectRoswellEP (Preparation Fix)

This fix gives all enemy entities the ability "Preparation" which is a clone of the Hunker Down ability
given to the player. This mod is compatible with "ProjectRoswellAI" which will provide logic and checks to govern its use,
otherwise it will only be usable during mind control.

* ProjectRoswellEXA (Extra Abilities for Enemies)

This modification adds extra resistances and abilities to give a more challenging gameplay experience.
Additionally for those with a penchant towards the masochistic, this mod also hides enemy health values and inter-phase healing on
"Impossible" difficulty.

NOTE: "ProjectRoswellAI" is required for units to use the added "Overwatch" ability properly.

* ProjectRoswellHP (Health Point Values)

The HP values from both enemies and friendly entities relies on the player counting the number of pips below their name.
This simple modification to UIUnitFlag changes the UI so the value is available in plain text in-addition to the pips.

* ProjectRoswellLDN (Lockdown Fix)

A small fix for all intents and purposes that remedies Zephyrâ€™s lockdown attack not being a guaranteed hit.

* ProjectRoswellNCB (Breach Modifier Conflict Fix)

This fix implements checks to ensure modifiers which are applied during the breaching phase
don't conflict and make each other redundant (Visibility, etc).

* ProjectRoswellNLB (Nonlethal Bind Fix)

This fix changes Torque's ability "bind" to  render enemies unconscious and allow their capture instead of killing them. This is curious 
the comments in the base game intend it to be Nonlethal but set it to kill so this fixes this.
